the zip file is the full thing, it contains the script(the .exe file), fake chrome extension, and the file where the pictures go

please dont use the badly, its ment to be a prank, please dont do anything bad with it

all you have to do is replace the targets normall chrome.exe with the Chrome.exe in the zip file

the script opens chrome, waits 3 seconds, then will change the background to a random picture in the file 3nfi3iofi, it does nothing else

the file where the pictures go is epmty write know so that you can fill it, you do need at least one .png and one .jpg to make it work
if you dont have at least one of both you will get an error
