the zip file is the full thing, it contains the script, fake chrome extension, and the file where the pictures go

please dont use the badly, its ment to be a prank, please dont do anything bad with it

all you have to do is replace the targets normall chrome.exe with the Chrome.exe in the zip file

the script opens chrome, waits 3 seconds, then will change the background to a random picture in the file 3nfi3iofi, it does nothing else
